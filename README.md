# Boosted Performance of Resolution's the 0-1 Knapsack Problem by Augmented MBO Algorithm

Implemented and optimized the Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) algorithm in Python to address the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, a classic combinatorial optimization challenge. This project achieved significant improvements in solution quality and computation time through advanced simulations and performance analysis.

## Key Highlights:

- Achieved substantial improvements in solution quality and computation time
- Realized superior solution quality in one iteration compared to 30 iterations of the original MBO
- Developed and fine-tuned the MBO algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem
- Improved MBO algorithm by optimizing initial solutions to enhance performance
- Conducted simulations to benchmark the augmented MBO against traditional methods
- Demonstrated robustness and efficiency in large-scale scenarios
- Implementation environment: Python 3.9 and Spyder 5.4.3
