# Migrating-Birds-Optimization-for-Knapsack-Problems
Boosted performance of resolution's the 0-1 knapsack problem, a metaheuristic optimization problem, by means of optimized the initial solutions of the Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) algorithm. While reaching in 30 loops to the solution by the original MBO algorithm, achieving in 1 loop to the better solution by the optimized algorithm.
Solving Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) and 0-1 Knapsack problems using Python. Comparison of 0-1 knapsack, bounded knapsack, fractional knapsack and MBO methods. 
Implementation environment: Python 3.9 and Spyder 5.4.3
