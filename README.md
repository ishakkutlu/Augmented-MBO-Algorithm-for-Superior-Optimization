# Boosted Performance of Resolution's the 0-1 Knapsack Problem by Augmented MBO Algorithm
Boosted performance of resolution's the 0-1 knapsack problem, a metaheuristic optimization problem, by means of optimized the initial solutions of the Migrating Birds Optimization (MBO) algorithm. While reaching in 30 loops to the solution by the original MBO algorithm, achieving in 1 loop to the better solution by the optimized algorithm. You can access Python implementation files from my GitHub account.

Implementation environment: Python 3.9 and Spyder 5.4.3
